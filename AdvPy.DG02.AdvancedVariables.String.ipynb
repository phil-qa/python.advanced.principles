    "\n",
    "When a list element is removed or deleted, it's not immediately erased from memory. Instead, it gets added to the list's internal free list.   \n",
    "The free list essentially becomes a pool of previously used memory chunks that can be reused when new elements are added to the list. This avoids the overhead of constantly allocating and deallocating memory for list operations.\n",

    "**Performance**: Reusing memory from the free list is faster than allocating entirely new memory for every list insertion. This improves the overall performance of list operations.  \n",
