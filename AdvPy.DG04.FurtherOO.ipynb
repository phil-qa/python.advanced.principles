    "## More OO\n",
    "\n",
    "in this section we will cover a number of interesting subjects associated with object orientation. \n",
    "we will revise some points such as decorators we looked at earlier, as wll as name mangling in Python as it tries to be all private. We will also get a look at the special built-in operators and the fact that they can be overwritten, and looking at the new-style classes. Finally in revising them we will look at how python deals with getters and setters (properties)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixins\n",
    "In Python, a mixin is a class that provides a specific functionality that can be inherited by other classes without requiring a full inheritance hierarchy. A mixin is typically used to add or enhance the behavior of a class, without modifying its implementation.So it is not meant to be instantiated on its own, but instead, it is meant to be subclassed by other classes. which then gains the functionality provided by the mixin, as if the methods and attributes of the mixin were defined in the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Duck typing\n",
    "A foundation concept of Object Orientation is that messages are\n",
    "sent to objects requesting actions. We should not need to check\n",
    "the class of the object, only that it can carry out the action\n",
    "requested. That principle has been lost with many OO languages,\n",
    "particularly static ones. Even those that fully support\n",
    "polymorphism, the practice is often to test the class rather than\n",
    "the behaviour.\n",
    "Python, and most dynamic languages, allows the programmer to\n",
    "check if behaviour exists. This is called Duck Typing: we don't care\n",
    "what kind of thing it is, if it quacks that's good enough. It could be\n",
    "some kind of duck mimic, who cares?\n",
    "This is why type is deprecated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### getattr, hasattr and setattr\n",
    "We will review the built in functions getattr which will return the value of an atribute we will see that these call the special methods under the hood __getattr__() __setattr()__ \n",
    "\n",
    "additionally we will mention delegation which, unlike other languages, has no keyword. It's a popular OO pattern allonwing objects to call other objects at runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "### slots\n",
    "We will mention slots, as a new thing, it's a manual method of developing a class dictionary and it looks like a neat way of hiding things, but it has problems, the key word there being manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance introspection\n",
    "This is a preferred way of finding out if an object or class belongs to a particular class, we have already seen this though, isinstance() and issubclass() \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## context managers\n",
    "we will look at  context managers, that can initialise and destroy objects within a context, it provides a more stable approach than something like '__del__'\n"

    "### Class Method\n",
    "A class method is bound to a class rather than its instance so no necessity to create a class instance. This is much similar to the static method.\n",
    "The parameters of the Class method is predominantly the class itself and hence it associates with it. Therefore class methods operate at a global class level\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to note that you can access a class method using either the class or a concrete instance of the class at hand\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike regular methods, class methods don’t take the current instance, self, as an argument. Instead, they take the class itself, which is commonly passed in as the cls argument. Using cls to name this argument is a popular convention in the Python community."
