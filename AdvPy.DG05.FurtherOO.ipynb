    "## More OO\n",
    "\n",
    "in this section we will cover a number of interesting subjects associated with object orientation. \n",
    "we will revise some points such as decorators we looked at earlier, as well as name mangling in Python as it tries to be all private. We will also get a look at the special built-in operators and the fact that they can be overridden, and looking at the new-style classes. Finally in revising them we will look at how python deals with getters and setters (properties)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixins\n",
    "In Python, a mixin is a class that provides a specific functionality that can be inherited by other classes without requiring a full inheritance hierarchy. A mixin is typically used to add or enhance the behavior of a class, without modifying its implementation.So it is not meant to be instantiated on its own, but instead, it is meant to be subclassed by other classes. which then gains the functionality provided by the mixin, as if the methods and attributes of the mixin were defined in the class itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "additionally we will mention delegation which, unlike other languages, has no keyword. It's a popular OO pattern allonwing objects to call other objects at runtime. \n",
    "\n",
    "### slots\n",
    "We will mention slots, as a new thing, it's a manual method of developing a class dictionary and it looks like a neat way of hiding things, but it has problems, the key word there being manual.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inheritance introspection\n",
    "This is a preferred way of finding out if an object or class belongs to a particular class, we have already seen this though, isinstance() and issubclass() \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## context managers\n",
    "we will look at  context managers, that can initialise and destroy objects within a context, it provides a more stable approach than something like '\\__del__'\n"
