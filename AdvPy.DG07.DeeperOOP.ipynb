    "# Deeper patterns  \n",
    "## Creational \n",
    "In software design, creational patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on object creation mechanisms. They provide reusable solutions to common problems associated with how objects are instantiated and initialized. Here are some key points about creational patterns: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Promote code flexibility and decoupling by separating object creation logic from the code that uses the objects.\n",
    "- Allow for centralized control over object creation, making it easier to manage and customize object behavior.\n",
    "- Encourage the creation of well-formed objects with proper initialization and configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Singleton Pattern: Ensures that only a single instance of a class exists and provides a global access point to it.\n",
    "- Factory Pattern: Introduces a factory class responsible for creating objects based on a provided type.\n",
    "- Abstract Factory Pattern: Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.\n",
    "- Builder Pattern: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing for step-by-step object creation with customization options.\n",
    "- Prototype Pattern: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, avoiding the overhead of creating objects from scratch."
