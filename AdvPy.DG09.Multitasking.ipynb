    "# Multitasking\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, multitasking refers to the ability of a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently or simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides various techniques for achieving multitasking, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads: Threads are lightweight and independent units of execution within a program. They allow multiple tasks to run concurrently within the same process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processes: Processes are independent instances of a program that run in their own memory space. They can communicate with each other through inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asyncio: Asyncio is a Python library for writing asynchronous code. It provides a way to write concurrent code using coroutines, which are functions that can be paused and resumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these techniques, you can write programs that can perform multiple tasks concurrently, which can improve the efficiency and performance of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Things we will review \n",
    "- Processes and threads\n",
    "- Very basic threads in Python\n",
    "- The Fork/Join model\n",
    "- Synchronisation objects\n",
    "- Simple use of Lock\n",

    "\n",
    "## Processes and threads\n",
    "\n",
    "We guess that you probably know what a process is, but you might\n",
    "not have met threads before. Even if you have, through a\n",
    "language like C# or Java, then some aspects of Python\n",
    "multithreading may surprise you.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has strengths and it has weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming with threads is different. You never know when\n",
    "some other thread is going to alter the global resource you are\n",
    "using, so synchronisation is essential. Of course there is an\n",
    "overhead in doing that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python threading module is a high-level interface based on\n",
    "the thread module. If you have used threads procedurally, for\n",
    "example Win32 threads or pthreads from C/C++, then you will be\n",
    "familiar with the procedural interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fork join model\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at the fork join model \n",
    "\n",
    "The term is commonly used to describe the simple model of a\n",
    "single fork position, and a single place where we all join together\n",
    "again. It is a robust model that\n",
    "is well worth using.\n",
    "\n",
    "The General Threading Model can be chaotic - in more than one\n",
    "sense of the word. \n",
    "\n",
    "## issues with threads\n",
    "They are very difficult to code\n",
    "• Sharing variables requires locking mechanisms\n",
    "• Subtle timing differences can make debugging\n",
    "difficult\n",
    "The Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)\n",
    "• The GIL locks the interpreter\n",
    "• Threads are locked for about 100 byte-code\n",
    "instructions\n",
    "• Simplifies and protects the interpreter\n",
    "• Improvements to the GIL strategy in 3.2 reduces the\n",
    "overhead\n",
    "• The GIL does not mean that:\n",
    "• Python is not multi-threaded - C modules can multithread\n",

    "## Subprocess\n",
    "It is supposed to make all the OS operations as abstract as possible, decoupling from the requirement to provide a unified approach but it doesn't quite achieve that.   \n",
    "Some issues still remain : \n",
    "\n",
    "*Executable Path Handling*: The way executable paths are resolved can still vary between different operating systems. For example, the way environment variables are searched for executable paths or how the system's PATH variable is handled might differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Shell Features*: When executing commands through the subprocess module, shell features like environment variable expansion, wildcard expansion (globbing), and shell built-ins may behave differently or might not be available depending on the operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Signal Handling*: Signal handling can vary between operating systems. For example, the way signals are handled or the types of signals that are available might differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Process Management*: Process management functions such as forking, spawning, and waiting for subprocesses can have differences in behavior across operating systems due to variations in how processes are managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Process Communication*: While subprocess provides mechanisms for communication with subprocesses (such as pipes, stdin/stdout/stderr redirection), the specifics of how these are implemented may vary between operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Process Termination*: The way processes are terminated or killed can vary between operating systems. For example, the signals used for process termination or the process cleanup mechanisms might differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these differences, the subprocess module does a good job of abstracting away many of the low-level details, providing a consistent interface for launching and interacting with subprocesses across different platforms. However, it's important to be aware of these platform-specific differences when writing cross-platform code that utilizes the subprocess module."

    "- Thread local storage is to enable a thread to share a global variable between functions, but for that variable to be different for each thread. Generally this is a hack to allow a single threaded program to be converted to multi-threaded! avoid globals and you wont need this \n",
    "- Locks are often required, and represent the basic locking mechanism. A thread either has ownership of a lock or waits for it. \n",
    "- Semaphores on the other hand are not \"owned\" by anyone. We put a limit on the number of threads that can lock a semaphore, if more come along then they wait until a thread releases the semaphore.\n",
    "- Timers can be useful for triggering functions at specific times, or in specific intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple use of locks\n",

    "\n",
    "## Queues \n",
    "Task Queues: A task queue is a common pattern in which a set of worker threads pull tasks from a queue and execute them. The queue module provides the Queue class, which is a thread-safe implementation of a task queue. A use case of task queues can be found in a web application that receives requests and needs to perform tasks in the background, such as sending emails or generating reports.\n",

    "operation is atomic\n",
    "\n",
    "Queues are really designed for continuous use, and to terminate\n",
    "processing can be problematic. What you should not do is to\n",
    "terminate the primary thread without waiting for the worker\n",
    "threads to finish processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Queues are ideal for the producer-consumer model, where one\n",
    "set of processes adds data items into the queue and another set\n",
    "removes and processes them\n",
    "\n",
    "Message Passing: The queue module can also be used for message passing between threads. One thread can send messages to another thread by adding them to a queue, and the other thread can receive messages by removing them from the queue. This pattern can be useful in many applications that require inter-thread communication, such as distributed computing or real-time systems.\n"

    "## Python multiprocessing Process class\n",
    "Python multiprocessing Process class is an abstraction that sets up another Python process, provides it to run code and a way for the parent application to control execution. There are two important functions that belongs to the Process class - start() and join() function. At first, we need to write a function, that will be run by the process. Then, we need to instantiate a process object. If we create a process object, nothing will happen until we tell it to start processing via start() function. Then, the process will run and return its result. After that we tell the process to complete via join() function. Without join() function call, process will remain idle and won’t terminate. So if you create many processes and don’t terminate them, you may face scarcity of resources. Then you may need to kill them manually. One important thing is, if you want to pass any argument through the process you need to use args keyword argument. \n",
