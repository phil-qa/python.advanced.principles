    "# Multitasking\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, multitasking refers to the ability of a program to perform multiple tasks concurrently or simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides various techniques for achieving multitasking, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads: Threads are lightweight and independent units of execution within a program. They allow multiple tasks to run concurrently within the same process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processes: Processes are independent instances of a program that run in their own memory space. They can communicate with each other through inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Asyncio: Asyncio is a Python library for writing asynchronous code. It provides a way to write concurrent code using coroutines, which are functions that can be paused and resumed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these techniques, you can write programs that can perform multiple tasks concurrently, which can improve the efficiency and performance of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Things we will review \n",
    "- Processes and threads\n",
    "- Very basic threads in Python\n",
    "- The Fork/Join model\n",
    "- Synchronisation objects\n",
    "- Simple use of Lock\n",
    "- Queue objects\n",
    "- The trouble with threads\n",
    "- Using the multiprocessing module\n",
    "- Queue objects\n",
    "- concurrent.futures\n",
    "\n",
    "## Processes and threads\n",
    "\n",
    "We guess that you probably know what a process is, but you might\n",
    "not have met threads before. Even if you have, through a\n",
    "language like C# or Java, then some aspects of Python\n",
    "multithreading may surprise you.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has strengths and it has weaknesses\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming with threads is different. You never know when\n",
    "some other thread is going to alter the global resource you are\n",
    "using, so synchronisation is essential. Of course there is an\n",
    "overhead in doing that.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python threading module is a high-level interface based on\n",
    "the thread module. If you have used threads procedurally, for\n",
    "example Win32 threads or pthreads from C/C++, then you will be\n",
    "familiar with the procedural interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fork join model\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at the fork join model \n",
    "\n",
    "The term is commonly used to describe the simple model of a\n",
    "single fork position, and a single place where we all join together\n",
    "again. It is a robust model that\n",
    "is well worth using.\n",
    "\n",
    "The General Threading Model can be chaotic - in more than one\n",
    "sense of the word. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Synchronisation objects\n",
    "\n",
    "The threading module contains a ranges of objects that can be\n",
    "used for thread synchronisation.\n",
    "Condition variables come from the POSIX pthreads runtime library\n",
    "and include a Lock to protect a predicate. They are generally more\n",
    "complex to use than Events.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple use of locks\n",
    "we will lool at creating locks to create a \"Critical Section\"\n",
    "of code (the term Critical Section comes from Windows and\n",
    "indicates code which can only run in one thread at a time).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Queues \n",
    "We will look at queues The Queue/queue module supplies a serialised communication\n",
    "mechanism between threads. All the locking is done for us - we do\n",
    "not need to worry about atomicity and other nasty details - every\n",
    "operation is atomic\n",
