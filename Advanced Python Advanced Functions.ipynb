    "# Advanced functions top summary\n",

    "## Passing parameters\n",
    "Parameters can be passed by position or name or default \n",
    "In this chapter would be looking at some of the more advanced features to do with functions and we begin that by looking at things like primer to pass it the mechanisms that we know and some of the approaches that are more commonly known another c languages such as a variadic  function, Which is a function that accepts a variable number of arguments. \n",
    "functionality like this this can be achieved in a couple of ways, kwargs for example, leverage flexibility in the same way, and Python allows for passing flexible containers in this way. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python gotchas default parameter\n",
    "Pythons flexibility which is expressed in the ability to pass whatever we like into functions, has to be balanced with the knowledge that the outcomes of implementing those freedoms sometimes have unintended results.  one such example is the default parameter trap \n",
    "\n",
    "## Recursion\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding what may result in  the use of functions in certain contexts is a responsibility of the programmer such that whatever is being developed doesn't behave in ways which are unexpected, much as we've just   mentioned with a default parameter to trap. we'll look at methods by which you might want to observe things like recursion and default values in this chapter whereby with me understand how much recursion is possible under a default condition, and again this is something that we want to be aware of in complex programmes within python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dispatch table\n",
    "\n",
    "We will have a look at a very useful creation of a dispatch table which, using a dictionary type structure, maps keys to functions which execute according to the key used  at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Operator.Itemgetter()\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at Operator.Itemgetter where the operator module is commonly used as a procedural interface to the python bulit-in special methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nested Funtions\n",
    "\n",
    "Nested functions, that is placing a function iside another, is not something which all languages support. We will review that, indeed we will have to remember that there are issues with scope in python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Closures\n",
    "A closure is a function object that remembers values in enclosing scopes even if they are not present in memory. It is a record that stores a function together with an environment: a mapping associating each free variable of the function (variables that are used locally, but defined in an enclosing scope) with the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was created.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Decorators\n",
    "We will look at how decorators are used, a requirement that comes from metaprogramming (used for developing frameworks) which is code that modifies code at runtime. Although this is a look at one aspect we look again at metaprogramming later. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Partial evaluation of arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at functools.partial that allows for partial evaluation of a function, the rest being used in different contexts later in the execution. We will note the difference between lambda and this\n"
