    "AF_INET is an address family that is used to designate the type of addresses that your socket can communicate with (in this case, Internet Protocol v4 addresses). When you create a socket, you have to specify its address family, and then you can only use addresses of that type with the socket. The Linux kernel, for example, supports 29 other address families such as UNIX (AF_UNIX) sockets and IPX (AF_IPX), and also communications with IRDA and Bluetooth (AF_IRDA and AF_BLUETOOTH, but it is doubtful you'll use these at such a low level).\n",

    "will normally cause the process to block, waiting for a request. If \n",
    "there are requests (on the queue specified with listen()), then a \n",
    "connection is made.\n",
    "accept() returns a new socket object with the same characteristics \n",
    "as the listening socket, which is then used to transfer the data \n",
