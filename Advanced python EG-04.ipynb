    "Exercise 4 – Further OO\n",
    "Objective\n",
    "To experiment with some of the special attribute methods.\n",
    "Overview\n",
    "The first exercise is to set attributes using names that are derived, and the second is just a teaser.  The third question is to implement another special function, with a slight twist.  Finally we take an existing module and create a context manager class.\n",
    "Questions\n",
    "1.\tTake a look at the code in country.py.  It is a class (from an earlier course) that does various operations on country data.  \n",
    "The country data is stored in a list attribute called __attr, read from a CSV string passed in to the constructor.\n",
    "The class itself has a dictionary called index.  This gives the names of the data items and their positions in __attr.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now we cannot list individual items like country name (cname) and population.  Write a generalised get function to access fields, provided the name requested appears in index.  \n",
    "For this you can implement __getattribute__ or __getattr__.  But which one?\n",
    "Uncomment the first set of tests (after the __main__ check) to test.\n",
    " \n",
    "2.\tIn 2005, Myanmar (a.k.a. Burma) changed its capital city from Yangon to Naypyidaw.  Change the capital attribute in the myanmar object to the new value.  This code is already in the program, just comment it out.\n",
    "Did you have to implement any more special methods for that to work?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tWe wish to allow the user to delete any attribute using the del() built-in function (yes, we know that is unusual).  \n",
    "Implement a special function to allow that, but on deletion replace the existing attribute value with an empty string or zero, depending on the class of the attribute.  \n",
    "Hint: isinstance().\n",
    "Comment out the question 3 tests to check your code.\n",
    "4.\t For timing we sometimes use a home-grown module known as mytimer.py, and there is an example in the labs directory.  It can be tested using stems.py.  Both these files are used later in the course!\n",
    "Here is the help text for mytimer:\n",
    "\n",
    "DESCRIPTION\n",
    "This user written module contains a simple mechanism for timing operations from   Python.  It contains two functions, start_timer(), which must be called first to initialise the  present time, and end_timer() which calculates the elapsed CPU time and displays it.\n",
    "\n",
    "FUNCTIONS\n",
    "end_timer(txt='End time')\n",
    "The end_timer() function completes a timed interval started by start_timer.  It prints an optional text message (default 'End time') followed by the CPU time used in seconds. \n",
    "This function has one optional parameter, the text to be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "start_timer()\n",
    "The start_timer() function marks the start of a timed interval, to be completed by end_timer().\n",
    "This function requires no parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Append a context manager class, called Mytimer, to this module.  It will require three methods:\n",
    "__init__\tSet the text message to be passed to end_timer()as an\n",
    "attribute.\n",
    "__enter__\tCalls start_timer()\n",
    "__exit__\tCalls end_timer(), passing the attribute set above.  \n",
    "There is no requirement to carry out any exception handling here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now modify stems.py so that it uses the mytimer.Mytimer class as a context manager, i.e. replacing the calls to start_timer() and end_timer() to use with.   There are two such timing sections in the code. \n",
    "Solutions\n",
    "1.\tThe __getattr__ function is required.  If we used __gettattribute__ then that would get called even when reading __attr. \n",
    "   ### TODO: implement an attribute get function\n",
    "    def __getattr__(self, attr):\n",
    "        if attr in Country.index:\n",
    "            return self.__attr[Country.index[attr]]\n",
    "        else:\n",
    "            raise(AttributeError)\n",
    " \n",
    "2.\tNo, we did not have to implement any extra methods to be able to alter attributes.  Indeed, if we had tried to implement __setattr__ then that would have been called from __init__ as well!\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\tWe had to implement the __delattr__ function, but there was an extra check we had to do on the type of the field.\n",
    "        # TODO: implement an attribute delete function\n",
    "    def __delattr__(self, attr):\n",
    "        if attr in Country.index:\n",
    "            if isinstance(self.__attr[Country.index[attr]], int):\n",
    "                self.__attr[Country.index[attr]] = 0\n",
    "            else:\n",
    "                self.__attr[Country.index[attr]] = \"\"\n",
