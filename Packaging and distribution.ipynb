    "# Distributing and packaging\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, packaging and distribution refer to the process of preparing and sharing Python code so that it can be easily installed and used by others. This process typically involves creating a package, which is a collection of Python modules and resources, and making it available for installation via a package manager.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Package**: A package is a collection of Python modules and other resources (such as data files, documentation, etc.) that are organized together for a specific purpose. Packages are typically distributed as archives (e.g., .tar.gz, .zip) and can be installed using a package manager. Packages can be distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Control data, metadata**: For each package there has to be a manifest or data that describes the structure of the installation package, usually this is in setup.py\n",
    "\n",
    "**Package manager**:\n",
    "There are a number of ways of controlling the distribution, a package manager is probably the best approach, if the metadata is well formed and external dependencies available, then this is the most practical method. pip is a great example.   \n",
    "PyPI is the official repository for Python packages. It hosts thousands of open-source Python packages that can be installed using pip. Developers can upload their packages to PyPI to share them with the Python community.   \n"

    "\n",
    "- Consistency across platforms: Wheels are platform-specific, meaning separate wheel files are provided for different operating systems and Python versions. This ensures compatibility and consistency when installing packages on different platforms.\n",
